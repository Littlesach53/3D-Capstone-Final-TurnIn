  initialDialog:
  - Hey there! I've been thinking of making a few improvements to my home, and I
    was wondering if you could lend a hand.
  - Well, you see, my humble abode could really use a nice table and a sink. A cozy
    place to eat and a convenient spot to wash up.
  - Something simple and sturdy would be perfect. For the table, maybe a nice wooden
    one, and for the sink, just something functional with a bit of charm.
  - You think you could help me?
  acceptOption: Sure how should I get these items
  acceptAnswer: Thank you so much! just find the materials and craft them yourself
    then bring them back to me.  I can't wait to have a cozy dining space and a convenient
    place to clean up. It'll make my home feel much more welcoming.
  declineOption: Sorry I can't right now
  declineAnswer: Oh darn well I guess I'll keep eating on the floor.
  comebackAfterDecline: Have you changed your mind about helping me?
  comebackInProgress: I still need those pieces of furniture
  comebackCompleted: 'Oh thank you so much they look great. now if you will exuse
    me I need to go wash some dishes. '
  finalWords: thanks again for all the help.
