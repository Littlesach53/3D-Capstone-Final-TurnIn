  - Hello there! I've been thinking about the village market, and I believe it's
    time for an upgrade. Do you think you could lend a hand?
  - Well, you see, our current market stalls are a bit worn, and the layout could
    be more efficient. I'm thinking we need new sturdy timber for the stalls, some
    colorful fabrics for decorations, and perhaps a skilled planner to help redesign
    the layout.
  - 'anything you can do to help would be greatly appriciated. do you think you can
    lend a hand? '
